Description: 

Why is innovation difficult for museums? Why are museums often seen as ‘conservative’ while in truth their collections tell the story of a humanity that is diverse, dynamic, and ever-changing? Often it seems that museums lag behind both business and academia in their ability to adapt to new constituencies, take advantage of new opportunities, and embrace risk. We might ask, ‘why can’t a museum be more like a start- up?’ Start-ups and their methodologies are often seen as the best model for innovation the 21st century has to offer; can museum organisations be more flexible, agile and entrepreneurial to re-invent themselves?

There are some good reasons why a museum cannot be like a start-up. Take for example, the notion of ‘fail early, fail fast, fail forward’5. It is normal for an entrepreneur to have several unsuccessful initiatives before success. On the other hand, a museum leader cannot simply ‘fail’ several museums before getting it right. The requirement to preserve, protect, and present collections necessitates long-term thinking and risk aversion, which are not requirements for an entrepreneur. Museum decisions take longer, finances must be carefully planned, and the museum ‘brand’ must be protected.

However, within this context, top-down political institutions and bottom-up citizen initiatives currently encourage museum organisations to question and re-invent their relationship with artists, researchers, their communities and audiences. A new type of museum is evolving. Diane Dubray from We Are Museums defines this new museum as ‘open to all, ever changing place, in the service of humanity, where curators share, experiment, inspire and immerse the users into their past, present and future self-development.’
