Process: 

1. Identify the best people to contact in both the museum and maker communities
2. Organise a 2 day workshops for museums and makers
3. Invite local museum and maker practitioners to see how they
can collaborate and inspire makers to respond and work with museums and their collections
4. Document this, the results are really insightful (e.g. that there is still a hesitancy to see the museum as ‘their’ space)

----

Outputs: 

1. New Museum and Makers group
2. Regular meetings with this group
3. Maker-in-Residence programme held in your museum

----

Communication: 

- Put a call out your local museum and maker networks
- Advertise the event in the museum’s newsletter
- Advertise it on Facebook, Twitter and other social media
- Link in with local museum networks e.g. Irish Museum’s Association
- Document the event on film and disseminate on You Tube

----

Success: 

- Change in attitude by staff towards projection mapping as an interpretative response to the collections
- ‘Museum and Makers’ group meet regularly
