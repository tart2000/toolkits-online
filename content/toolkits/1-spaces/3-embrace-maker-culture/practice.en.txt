Goals: 

- Introduce and mainstream the concept that makers can collaborate with museums and vice versa in the design and delivery of programmes
- Respond and create installations and possibly lead to co-curate exhibitions as well as specific projects

----

Process: 

1. Identify why you want to make contact with the local maker community and the advantages over existing museum connections
2. Find good examples of this elsewhere that you can refer to in your research
3. Design programmes with makers in mind e.g. maker-related themes for workshops for children, teens and adults
4. Invite local makers such as animators, electronic engineers and sound engineers to the museum to collaborate in the design of the summer programmes. If you do not have access to the technological equipment required for these workshops, the collaboration is paramount in the design and delivery of the programmes
5. Introduce new arts forms to the public programme which may seem ‘irrelevant’ to the collection in the museum, i.e. introduce a series of workshops including robot-making, animation and digital sound-making
6. Experiment with new ideas and how young people can learn through hands-on processes which take time and the use of technology which the museum may not have to-hand Mainstream these ideas in public programmes

----

Outputs: 

1. Week-long summer programmes of arts and technology-driven workshops
2. Introduction of electronic engineering (robot-making), anima- tion and sound engineering workshops to the museum
3. Experimentation with untried techniques
4. Evaluation data
5. Documentation
6. Workshops featured in regular blog and newsletter
7. Social media strategy (Facebook and Twitter)

----

Communication: 

- Mutual respect and understanding with all involved
- Meet face-to-face where necessary, i.e. go out of the museum to meet key people both within and outside working hours
- Email, Facebook, Twitter, What’s App, Eventbrite are useful
tools

----

Success: 

- Positive response of the local maker community
- Official recognition, e.g. ICOM CECA Best Practice Award
- Local contacts throughout the maker community are now
familiar with your programme and initiatives
- Submissions of articles on engagement of young people in museums at a number of conferences

----

Example: bring makers into the museum

Tips: 

- 
  tip: >
    Keep things light and pleasant no matter
    what. If at first you do not succeed,
    there definitely is another way
- 
  tip: >
    Be open to new ideas and test them out
    in programmes
- 
  tip: Feedback to the museum and makers
- 
  tip: >
    Keep track of the progress for reports
    or any ‘fact-driven’ reports or
    grant applications illustrated with
    photographs
- 
  tip: >
    Write about your experiences and
    disseminate
