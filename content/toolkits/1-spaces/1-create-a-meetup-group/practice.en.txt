Text: 

----

Example: Museum lab meetup Group

----

Communication: 

- Meetup.com provides tools for communication with your group members and promoting the group to other meetup.com users
- Attending other meet-ups is an important method of making connections and promoting your own group
- Meet-up events can easily be cross-posted to your personal and professional social media channels, as well as your institutions media channels
- Meetup.com also provides a platform for storing and sharing images from your events

----

Process: 

1. Identify how much approval you have/need from your institution. This will affect how you name, promote, and present your group
2. Identify what your current ‘Space for Yes’ is and what you can offer your meet-up members
3. Join other meetup groups for creative and technical people. Attend some of those meetups to see how they operate, who attends them, and develop relationships
4. Come up with a name for your group
5. Set up a meetup group on Meetup.com
6. Pick a date (soon) for the first meeting
7. Pick a location where your group can meet in the museum.
If you have to meet outside the museum, include a museum
visit in your first meeting
8. Promote your first meeting heavily at other meetup groups 9. At the first meeting, ask your attendees: ‘What do you want
from this group, and from your institution?’ Take notes on a
whiteboard or flipchart
10. On another whiteboard/notepad, ask your members to
introduce themselves, and to list their interests/skills
11. On another whiteboard/notepad, list everything in your museum’s ‘Space for Yes’, i.e. everything your institution has
to offer members
12. On a fourth pad, encourage your members to brainstorm
intersections between their skills/interests and your ‘Space for Yes’. These intersections are the seeds of ideas for types of activities you can programme in future meet-ups
13. At this first meet-up, set a date for your next meet-up, where you will engage in one of the activities you generated
14. At the next meet-up, do the activity, and repeat the brainstorming activity so new members have an opportunity to participate
15. After a few of these meet-ups, identify the most active members and encourage them to take a leadership role in the group

Success: 

- Monthly meetups that average 15-20 people can be considered highly successful
- A good mix of regular and new members
- 1 or 2 continuous projects that are maintained by members, at any given time, coming to completion roughly every 3 months
- A membership that takes on leadership roles and serve as ambassadors for the group

Tips: 

- 
  tip: 'Be aware of the expectations of the audience: meetings can be as formal as presentations and panels, or as informal as drinks in a bar, workshops, or museum visits'
- 
  tip: >
    Decide how much of your time you are
    willing to put in outside of work hours?
    Most of your meetings will be the
    evenings
- 
  tip: >
    Encourage your members to bring food and
    drinks to share with the group

Acat: team

Baseline: Turn your museum into a gathering space

----

Goals: 

- Use an established online tool (in this case Meetup.com) to create a new community
- Connect with communities that are interested in creative and experimental use of your collection
- Give outsiders a creative stake in your institution, and a sense that their voices are heard
- Maintain those relationships and scale the interaction models you develop
